# S4E6 - Classification with an Academic Success Dataset

Prediction for whether a student is Enrolled, Graduated or dropped out based on a mixed set of continous and categorical features. Used this to experiment with the autogluon library for automl, optuna for semi-manual hyperparameter tuning and also tested some ensembling methods.

Because of the number of features involved in the challenge, I also tested different eda visualizations to see if there was anything interpretable (UMAP, PCA, Mann-Whitney), but for this dataset, it didnt seem immediately visually separable by any of these means.
