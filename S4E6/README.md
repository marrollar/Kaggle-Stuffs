# S4E6 - Classificatino with an Academic Success Dataset

Prediction for whether a student is Enrolled, Graduated or dropped out based on a mixed set of continous and categorical features. Used this to experiment with the autogluon library as well as tested out some ensembling methods.

Because of the number of features involved in the challenge, I also tested different eda visualizations to see if there was anything interpretable (UMAP, PCA, Mann-Whitney), but for this dataset, it didnt seem immediately visually separable by any of these means.
